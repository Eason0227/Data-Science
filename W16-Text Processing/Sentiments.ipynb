It aims to gauge the subjective judgments and feelings in the texts.\n","\n","In its simplest form it is a multiclass text classification text where the text is classified into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. The number of classes can vary according to the nature of the task, for example it can include emotions like happy, angry and sad. \n","\n","\n","\n","#### Application of sentiment analysis\n","Sentiment analysis has applications in a wide variety of domains including analyzing user reviews, tweet sentiment, etc. Let’s go through some of them here:\n","\n","- Social media monitoring: analyzing trends and opinitions\n","- Movie reviews: Analysing online movie reviews and feedback to judge the quality of the movie, \n","- News sentiment analysis: analyzing trends and their sentiments \n","- Brand monitoring and market research: understanding what users are saying about a product\n","- medical uses: monitoring for depression in a person\n","\n","\n","#### Rule-based sentiment analysis\n","Rule-based sentiment analysis is one of the very basic approaches to calculate text sentiments. It only requires minimal pre-work and the idea is quite simple, this method does not use any machine learning to figure out the text sentiment. For example, we can figure out the sentiments of a sentence by counting the number of times the user has used the word “sad” in his/her tweet. \n","\n","Now, let’s check out some python packages that work using this method.\n","\n","Install the following:\n","\n","- textblob\n","- vader: \n","- flair"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xGdS9ALBKYZ7"},"source":["### Textblob \n","It is a simple python library that offers API access to different NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, spelling correction, etc.\n","\n","Textblob sentiment analyzer returns two properties for a given input sentence:polarity and subjectivity\n","\n","The sentiment property returns a namedtuple of the form Sentiment(polarity, subjectivity). The polarity score is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0]. The subjectivity is a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective.
